## OVERVIEW

This project concerns setting up Active Directory Domain Controller on Windows Server 2019. 

By building this, I want to learn more about creating/disabling user accounts, structuring the domain using Organization Units, 
and applying group policies. This server was built using Oracle VirtualBox

### Steps

I changed the VMâ€™s network adapter from NAT to bridged mode to allow the machine to communicate directly on the local network.

After the Windows Server Installation Process, install Active Directory Domain Services on Server Manager. 

Manage > Add Roles and Features > Server Roles > Active Directory Domain Services (Also added DNS and DHCP for later)

Once Domain Services have installed, deployment configuration must be set up.

This gives you the option to either add a domain controller to an existing domain, add a new domain to an existing forest, 

or create an entirely new forest. Since this is an entirely new domain environment, a new forest will be created

After the deployment config, it is important to promote the server as a domain controller because it elevates the server to

be able to manage domain authentication, user accounts, and network resources. 

### What I learned

I learned how to set up a Windows Server using virtualization, and the steps to set up Active Directory Domain Services. 

### What's Next?

Next, I will use AD to create users, groups, OUs, and GPOs in my domain. I will use Server to share network resources with users in the domain.
